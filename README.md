# Installing dependencies

The ionic app depends on the **Ionic** and **cordova** packages installed globally from npm. To get them run:

```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Pro tip: for faster installs you should use yarn. To install it run:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

and then to install the dependencies run

```bash
yarn global add ionic cordova
```
# Running the app

To run the app simply run:

```bash
ionic serve
```
